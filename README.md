# VisionDrink
VisionDrink is a machine vision project to make TV/Movie drinking games easier. VisionDrink will analyse videos as they run for a set of defined scenarios. When these scenarios occur VisionDrink will indicate participants must drink. This allows you to set complex sets of rules for TV show/Movie drinking games and dont have to remember them all!\

An example of this is the show "Forged in Fire" in which a set of drinking rules posted by hellotrickster (bottom of read me), whilst funny and fun with ample opportunities to drink, there are many rules to remember. \
I will be making this system to display drink prompts when these scenarios occur, taking out the need to remember them all.\

I see a few possible ways forward, preparsing a video and tagging the scenarios then displaying the prompts when the video is actually viewed. Or alternatively attempting to detect the scenarios in real time.\
