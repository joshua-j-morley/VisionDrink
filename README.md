# VisionDrink
VisionDrink is a machine vision project to make TV/Movie drinking games easier. VisionDrink will analyse videos as they run for a set of defined scenarios. When these scenarios occur VisionDrink will indicate participants must drink. This allows you to set complex sets of rules for TV show/Movie drinking games and dont have to remember them all!
